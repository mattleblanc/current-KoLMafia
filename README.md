current-KoLMafia
================

A simple script to automatically download and launch the current build of KoL Mafia, an advanced interface for the online adventure game Kingdom of Loathing.

You can obtain the script by checking out the repository from the command line, like this:

`git clone git@github.com:mattleblanc/current-KoLMafia.git kolmafia/`

... or you can just grab it directly, like this:

`curl -O https://raw.githubusercontent.com/mattleblanc/current-KoLMafia/master/getLatestBuild.sh`

Running this script will download the latest hourly build of KoL Mafia to the folder you call the script from. It will then launch the .jar file using java ... if you can open the hourly builds when you manually download them, I am going to assume that you've got that figured out already.
